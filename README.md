# TCP/IP Server–Client Models in C

This repository contains multiple TCP/IP server–client implementations in C, focused on learning and experimenting with different designs of networked applications on Linux.

> **Goal:** Help beginners understand how TCP sockets work (server and client), and how to extend from simple single-client models to concurrent servers using processes.
